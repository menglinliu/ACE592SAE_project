# ACE592SAE_project
This is a class project, our interest is to find the correlation between temperature, rainfall and deforestration in Zambia.

- Data folder contains the csv files including data such as rainfall, temperature, deforestration, and household index and their geocodes. These data are used to plot accumulated annual changes in rainfall and temperature from 2015 to 2019 and accumulated annual changes in deforestration from 2014 to 2018 and map the household level changes in rainfall, temperature, and deforestration. Rainfall raster files are also included in the data folder, these rasters are used to show the ecological zones in Zambia.
- Jupyter_notebook folder includes the jupyter notebooks used to plot bar charts and temperature trends (in graphs folder), generate household level maps to show changes in rainfall, temperature, and deforestration (in maps folder), map the ecological zones in Zambia (in raster folder), pull the rainfall raster data (in raster folder) and temperature data (in temperature folder).
- Figures folder contains the household level changes in rainfall, temperature, and deforestraion in figure format and animation format, and the ecological zone maps.
- Presentaion folder include the presentaion we used in the class to present this project.
- Shapefile folder contains the shapefiles genearated when creating the household buffers used to plot the temperature, rainfall, and deforestraion data.
